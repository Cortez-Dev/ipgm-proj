<p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Years ago, it was raining hard. My friend was shuffling into a Starbucks when she saw a man behind her. She held the door for him. He saw her and stopped, grinning as the rain drenched her clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">&ldquo;Are you coming in?&rdquo; she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">The man just stood there, chuckling. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to watch you get soaked for being so stupid.&rdquo; He spent the rest of the time in line, mocking her. &ldquo;I bet you&rsquo;re one of those bleeding heart liberals,&rdquo; he kept saying. She ignored him. What else could she do?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">These kinds of little moments stick in my memory over the years, because they shed so much light on America. This one&rsquo;s a perfect metaphor for the 2020 election, and its aftermath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">A lot of us feel like my friend right now. We&rsquo;re trying to decide whether to hold open the door (again).</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-size:18px">We&rsquo;re Not Ready to Unite Yet</span></h1>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Usually after an election, we call on each other to put aside our differences and come together as Americans. We tried that in 2016.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">This year, it&rsquo;s not going to work. We can&rsquo;t put aside differences when those differences hinge on things like basic human rights and a belief in science. We can&rsquo;t look at the last four years and say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cool now.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">It&rsquo;s not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">I&rsquo;m not even sure what &ldquo;putting aside our differences&rdquo; means anymore. It can&rsquo;t mean looking the other way while one group tries to take away rights and freedoms from everyone else.</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-size:18px">We Have to Reject Trumpism to Move Forward</span></h1>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">My friend&rsquo;s story is a perfect example of Trumpism. You stand in the rain, so you can mock someone for trying to hold the door for you. Everyone loses, but you treat it as a victory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">That&rsquo;s Trumpism, a doctrine of mutually assured misery. Trump didn&rsquo;t invent this way of thinking. He just branded it. He put a red baseball cap on it, and sold it to 70 million people. So I&rsquo;m a little skeptical we&rsquo;ll be able to &ldquo;start the healing,&rdquo; like some Democrats have said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">We talk about the importance of respecting different political opinions. I&rsquo;m not sure that applies to Trump. It&rsquo;s hard to call what most of his supporters believe a<em>&nbsp;set of political opinions</em>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">They sound more like a bunch of prejudices.</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-size:18px">Political Commonplaces Aren&rsquo;t Opinions</span></h1>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">I know most of the so-called reasons Trump voters give for their support. Here they are, summarized:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size:18px">Trump isn&rsquo;t a career politician. He brings a fresh perspective.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Democrats are elitist. Trump is a normal guy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">At least Donald Trump says what he really thinks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">The left wing media hates Donald Trump, so he must be good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Trump actually cares about ordinary Americans.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">These aren&rsquo;t opinions. These are commonplaces: commonly held views that entered the mainstream conversation for one simple reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">They&nbsp;<em>sound&nbsp;</em>good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">That&rsquo;s all. There&rsquo;s not one shred of evidence to support these assertions. Trump&rsquo;s supporters can&rsquo;t point to one single tangible thing this president has done to show he cares about normal Americans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">I&rsquo;m one of the normal Americans Trump claims to care about. My extended family is full of ordinary people who voted for him. Our lives have either stayed the same for the last four years, or they&rsquo;ve gotten considerably worse. That&rsquo;s how I know better.</span></p>

<hr />
<h1><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Average Trump Supporters Don&rsquo;t Have Politics</span></strong></h1>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">My relatives have spent the last four years telling me how much they &ldquo;regret&rdquo; voting for Trump. They make fun of him. They admit they don&rsquo;t understand his tax plan, or his nonexistent healthcare plan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">They think his cabinet picks are jokes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">They supported Trump for a handful of reasons that had nothing to do with politics. They couldn&rsquo;t go against their evangelical heritage. They couldn&rsquo;t overcome their emotional blocks over abortion. They couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to learn what democratic socialism actually means.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">That&rsquo;s not a political opinion. That&rsquo;s laziness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">That&rsquo;s the privilege of getting to vote without understanding the issues, and being insulated from the fallout of your own ignorant decisions. Yes, these are harsh words for people I care about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">They&rsquo;re also true.</span></p>

<hr />
<h1><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Excuses Aren&rsquo;t Opinions</span></strong></h1>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Donald Trump&rsquo;s legacy will be one of hate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">He spent four years stoking anger and fear. The list of human rights violations under his administration is extensive, and well-documented. He blessed movements from white supremacist militias to anti-maskers, both of which have literally killed people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">When you vote for that, you don&rsquo;t have political opinions. What you have are excuses to tolerate hate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">There&rsquo;s never a good excuse for that. It makes them complicit. Every influential author and thinker from the last century will tell you the same thing. The people who voted for Trump made a choice to condone his hatred, and dismiss it as a minor inconvenience.</span></p>

<h1><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Threats and Complicity Aren&rsquo;t Opinions</span></strong></h1>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Showing up to a protest with an assault rifle isn&rsquo;t about declaring your rights, or expressing an opinion. A president who encourages such threats of violence is nothing but a dictator in disguise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">This is exactly what Trump has done. Under him, white supremacists and religious bigots have felt emboldened. Hate crimes have skyrocketed. Corrupt police murder civilians with impunity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Trump supporters have spent four years excusing his aggression, dismissing it as some kind of personality defect, or celebrating it. They&rsquo;ve looked the other way as Trump allowed and encouraged racist religious bigots to intimidate everyone else and deprive them of their rights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Supporting that isn&rsquo;t an opinion. It&rsquo;s complicity.</span></p>

<h1><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Close-Mindedness Isn&rsquo;t an Opinion</span></strong></h1>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Most of us have encountered Trump supporters who&rsquo;d rather suffer and die than let a Democrat &ldquo;have their way.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t matter what a Democratic candidate promises. They don&rsquo;t want it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Show them facts about the economy. Show them statistics about gun violence or system racism. Show them how nationalized healthcare works in other countries. They dismiss it all as&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;fake.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">They define sharing their opinion as belittling yours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">There&rsquo;s nothing you can do with this but walk away, which is what many of us have done the last four years. We don&rsquo;t know how to open someone&rsquo;s mind. The truth is, you can&rsquo;t.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">You have to wait for it to open on its own.</span></p>

<h1><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Begging for Empathy Isn&rsquo;t an Opinion</span></strong></h1>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Conservative pundits are calling for compassion and understanding toward Trump supporters in the wake of election results. Fox News anchors say, &ldquo;Remember how you felt when you lost.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Oh, we do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Some of us remember how it felt when our students praised Hitler as a &ldquo;very effective leader.&rdquo; We remember when our friends were attacked for wearing Bernie shirts after the election.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Empathy has limits. If someone wants our compassion and understanding, they have to give up hate first. That part&rsquo;s unconditional.</span></p>

<h1><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Chaos Isn&rsquo;t a Political Strategy</span></strong></h1>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Most Democrats I know tried listening to Trump supporters over the last four years. It was confusing. Instead of a uniform set of demands, we heard a bunch of noise about political correctness. We heard endless complaints about fake news media and liberal bias.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Chaos was the only thing Trump delivered. As a demagogue, he was a genius. As a leader, he was a failure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">He struggled to build a coalition within his own party. He bickered with his own cabinet, then fired almost&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>of them by the middle of his first term. He alienated most of his political allies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Trump had four years to prove everyone wrong, and deliver meaningful change. Instead, he spent his term in office tweeting and complaining, blaming his failures on everyone around him, and making a spectacle of himself. At times, it felt like he was doing it on purpose, as if he knew that&rsquo;s what would get him elected for a second term.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">It almost did.</span></p>

<h1><strong><span style="font-size:18px">This Is What We Need to Move Forward</span></strong></h1>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Right now, there aren&rsquo;t Republicans and Democrats. There are two Americas: those who stuck with Trump, and those who would&rsquo;ve voted for literally anyone else. If there&rsquo;s going to be any meaningful dialogue between these two Americas, the people who stuck with Trump need to decide what they actually want, and when they&rsquo;re ready to listen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">The rest of us are tired. We tried civil discourse. It&rsquo;s their turn to offer the olive branch this time. Until then, we&rsquo;re going to try to get some stuff done, with or without their help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Meanwhile, we&rsquo;ll prop open the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">That doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re going to stand out there in the cold rain getting soaked, and looking stupid.</span></p>
